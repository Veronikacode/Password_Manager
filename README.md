### Password manager 

### Description
Password manager is a project where you can create and keep your login credentials for specific sites. 
* With the "Search" button, you can find your existing data in the database.
* With the "Generate Password" button you can create your password.
* With the "Add" button, you can add your login credentials to data base.

For this project I used tkinter, pyperclip and JSON data.
